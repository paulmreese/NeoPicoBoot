**Install firmware before wiring the Pico W to your GameCube. Connecting power to the USB port after the mod has been wired will destroy the power board, at minimum. Please mod carefully.**

This should be enough information to guide someone through a basic installation. [A larger version of the image](/assets/NeoPicoBoot_Wiring_Diagram.jpg) is also included with this repo. This wiring incorporates [a method mentioned in an issue on the original PicoBoot Repo](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/issues/75#issuecomment-1539225503), which wires power into the **VSYS** pin of the Pico W instead of the **3V3** pin.

According to the [Raspberry Pi Pico W Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf):
> VSYS is the main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 1.8V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board SMPS to generate the 3.3V for the RP2040 and its GPIO.

> 3V3 is the main 3.3V supply to RP2040 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2040 load and VSYS voltage; it is recommended to keep the load on this pin under 300mA).

### RGB
As for the NeoPixels(WS2812, etc), this [video shows exactly how to mod your controller port board to add the NeoPixels](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=Boch__JV7q4JWGpH)

* [1:04](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=35ieH2EPR0lPXH_Q&t=64) - Remove the pins from each port. These pins can be removed from **either** the top *or* the bottom of each controller port. These LEDs can be very bright, so choose based on where you keep your GameCube. I personally use tweezers to snap the bottom ones so that I'm not competing with the battery for space.

* [3:25](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=mzvSUIralLa4HMga&t=205) - Create a strand of 5 NeoPixels. Make sure to leave a little bit of slack in the wires between each NeoPixel, especially to the power led and Pico W. Make sure the arrows on your NeoPixels point the same direction, and check continuity on the positive and negative wires regularly!

* [5:50](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=wtnrG3PIRv7RvrTk&t=350) - Remove stock LED. Optionally, also replace CR2032 Clock Battery. I would highly recommend replacing this battery with a separate battery holder and fresh battery.

* [6:25](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=p0bYnIFZQqc9hqtQ&t=385) - Hot glue controller port NeoPixels into place. Make sure they all point the same angle! You can remove the hot glue with rubbing alcohol. I've included [a 3D model of a basic alignment bracket as an STL file](/assets/NeoPixel_Bracket.stl) if you have access to a 3D printer. This bracket will only install below the controller ports, if you have a normally installed battery.

* [8:00](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=zBVIya90WfhzKUA-&t=480) - Hot glue Power NeoPixel. In my experience, you often need to seat the power LED lower than shown in the video for it to align correctly with the original light pipe. I recommend seating to the bottom of the notch on the PCB. This can sometimes involve sanding the PCB to the side to fit a NeoPixel.

Other than the NeoPixels being added, and **3V3** being swapped for **VSYS** from the 5V rail of the controller ports, the wiring works exactly like the original. So, if you need any additional help you can head over to [the PicoBoot wiki](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/wiki) for [the PicoBoot Installation guide](../../wiki/Installation-guide).

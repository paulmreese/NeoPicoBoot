# NeoPicoBoot: NeoPixel + PicoBoot
This is an IPL replacement modchip for Nintendo GameCube. It's open source, cheap, and easy to install.

## Features
* open source, easy to install
* uses $6 Raspberry Pi Pico W board
* RGB control for your controller ports and power LED
* easy-to-access NeoPixel web controls via Captive Portal
* boots any DOL app of your choice

## Installation guide

I've created a [visual installation guide](/assets/NeoPicoBoot Wiring diagram.jpg) to show the default wiring. This should be enough information to guide someone through a basic installation. This wiring incorporates [a method mentioned in an issue on the original PicoBoot Repo](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/issues/75#issuecomment-1539225503), which wires power into the **VSYS** pin of the Pico W instead of the **3V3** pin.

According to the [Raspberry Pi Pico W Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf):
> VSYS is the main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 1.8V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board SMPS to generate the 3.3V for the RP2040 and its GPIO.

> 3V3 is the main 3.3V supply to RP2040 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2040 load and VSYS voltage; it is recommended to keep the load on this pin under 300mA).

Other than the NeoPixels being added, and **3V3** being swapped for **VSYS** from the 5V rail of the controller ports, the wiring works exactly like the original. So, if you need any additional help you can head over to [the PicoBoot wiki](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/wiki) for [the PicoBoot Installation guide](../../wiki/Installation-guide).

Additionally, you can check the PicoBoot Discord Server to get support and discuss new features:

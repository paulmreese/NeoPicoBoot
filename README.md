# NeoPicoBoot: NeoPixel + PicoBoot
This is an IPL replacement modchip for Nintendo GameCube. It's also a WiFi Access Point hosting responsive RGB control. It's open source, cheap, and easy to install.

## Features
* open source, easy to install
* uses $6 Raspberry Pi Pico W board
* RGB control for your controller ports and power LED
* easy-to-access NeoPixel web controls via Captive Portal
* boots any DOL app of your choice

## Installation guide

### Pico W
I've created a [visual installation guide](/assets/NeoPicoBoot%20Wiring%20diagram.jpg) to show the default wiring. This should be enough information to guide someone through a basic installation. This wiring incorporates [a method mentioned in an issue on the original PicoBoot Repo](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/issues/75#issuecomment-1539225503), which wires power into the **VSYS** pin of the Pico W instead of the **3V3** pin.

According to the [Raspberry Pi Pico W Datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf):
> VSYS is the main system input voltage, which can vary in the allowed range 1.8V to 5.5V, and is used by the on-board SMPS to generate the 3.3V for the RP2040 and its GPIO.

> 3V3 is the main 3.3V supply to RP2040 and its I/O, generated by the on-board SMPS. This pin can be used to power external circuitry (maximum output current will depend on RP2040 load and VSYS voltage; it is recommended to keep the load on this pin under 300mA).

### RGB
As for the NeoPixels(WS2812, etc), this [video shows exactly how to mod your controller port board to add the NeoPixels](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=Boch__JV7q4JWGpH)
* [1:04](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=35ieH2EPR0lPXH_Q&t=64) - Remove the pins from each port. These pins can be removed from **either** the top *or* the bottom of each controller port. These LEDs can be very bright, so choose based on where you keep your GameCube. I personally use tweezers to snap the bottom ones so that I'm not competing with the battery for space.
* [3:25](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=mzvSUIralLa4HMga&t=205) - Create a strand of 5 NeoPixels. Make sure to leave a little bit of slack in the wires between each NeoPixel, especially to the power led and Pico W. Check continuity on the positive and negative wires regularly!
* [5:50](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=wtnrG3PIRv7RvrTk&t=350) - Remove stock LED. Optionally, also replace CR2032 Clock Battery. I would highly recommend replacing this battery with a separate battery holder and fresh battery.
* [6:25](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=p0bYnIFZQqc9hqtQ&t=385) - Hot glue NeoPixels in place. Make sure they all point the same angle! Good advice: you can remove the hot glue with rubbing alcohol.
* [8:00](https://youtu.be/1XUOI1c_viQ?si=zBVIya90WfhzKUA-&t=480) - Replace Power LED. In my experience, you often need to seat the power LED lower than shown for it to align correctly with the original light pipe. I recommend seating to the bottom of the notch on the PCB. This can sometimes involve sanding the PCB to fit a NeoPixel.


Other than the NeoPixels being added, and **3V3** being swapped for **VSYS** from the 5V rail of the controller ports, the wiring works exactly like the original. So, if you need any additional help you can head over to [the PicoBoot wiki](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/wiki) for [the PicoBoot Installation guide](../../wiki/Installation-guide).

Additionally, you can check the PicoBoot Discord Server to get support and discuss new features:

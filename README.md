## Installation guide

The complete installation guide has been moved to [a separate document](/INSTALLATION.md).

Other than the NeoPixels being added, and **3V3** being swapped for **VSYS** from the 5V rail of the controller ports, the wiring works exactly like the original. So, if you need any additional help you can head over to [the PicoBoot wiki](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/wiki) for [the PicoBoot Installation guide](../../wiki/Installation-guide).

Additionally, you can check the PicoBoot Discord Server to get support and discuss new features:

## 3D Printed Parts
Printing these `STL` files makes for a much simpler installation process, but neither is necessary.

* [PicoBoot Mount for the Nintendo Gamecube](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5482506) - This mounts the Pico W onto the controller port board. While other mounts exist, this one is convenient for 2 reasons:
    1. The wires can exit the motherboard towards the controller ports, without deforming the RF shielding.
    2. The NeoPixels can be closer to the Pico W itself, with shorter wires.
* [NeoPixel alignment bracket](/assets/NeoPixel_Bracket.stl) - This bracket helps to align all of the controller port NeoPixels with the correct spacing. It will only install below the controller ports, if you have a normally installed battery. This can be printed in PLA and hot-glued into place.
